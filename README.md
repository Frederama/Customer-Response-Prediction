# Customer-Response-Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
Build a scalable machine learning pipeline in **PySpark** to predict whether a customer will respond positively or negatively to a **marketing promotion campaign**. The project showcases how to implement end-to-end data preparation, model training, and evaluation in a distributed computing environment.

This pipeline is inspired by and adapted from a previously completed traditional Scikit-learn workflow, highlighting how to reproduce and scale it using PySpark's MLlib.

---

## 🧠 Workflow Summary

- ✅ Load and prepare customer annual and monthly data
- 🧼 Feature engineering using `VectorAssembler` and `StandardScaler`
- 🧪 Temporal-based train/test split
- 🔁 Fit and tune multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression (with L1 penalty)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- 📊 Evaluate model performance using AUC and precision-recall metrics

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
**Predict whether a customer will respond positively or negatively to a promotional campaign** based on transactional history features using annual and monthly datasets

---

## 📊 Models Used
- **Logistic Regression (L1-regularized)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is tuned using `CrossValidator` and `ParamGridBuilder` to maximize generalization performance.

---

## 📈 Results
- Logistic regression (L1-regularized) with Annual Data offered high interpretability and best generalization.
